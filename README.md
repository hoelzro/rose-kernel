# rOSe - Rob's Operating System Experiment

rOSe is a toy operating system that I'm writing for fun.

# Design

The design of rOSe is still up in the air; I have decided that I'd like
to try writing a microkernel, though.  That being said, I started this
project with very little idea on what I was doing, so I wouldn't be
surprised if this project had a lot of rewrites. =)

# What's with the name?

I had some trouble thinking of a good name (RobOS would just be silly),
until I thought of the quote "A rose by any any other name would smell
as sweet".  I liked the idea of "RoseOS", and when I realized that I
could backronym it to "Rob's Operating System Experiment", I knew I'd
found the right name.
